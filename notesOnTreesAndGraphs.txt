1. Walk    : Vertices may repeat. Edges may repeat (Closed or Open)
2. Trail     : Vertices may repeat. Edges cannot repeat (Open)
3. Circuit : Vertices may repeat. Edges cannot repeat (Closed)
4. Path     : Vertices cannot repeat. Edges cannot repeat (Open)
5. Cycle    : Vertices cannot repeat. Edges cannot repeat (Closed)

Observation 1: If vertices cannot repeat, edges cannot repeat too.  However, the other way round is not true.

Observation 2: Tree traversals are DFS when it comes to pre-fix, in-fix and post-fix.  However, level order traversal is BFS.

Observation 3: A connected DAG is a tree.  A DAG can be disconnected.  In this sense, a disconnected DAG is a forest!

There are a bunch of questions that I need to know the answers to.  To pose my questions, I first present a graph with five nodes and four edges.  These nodes are arranged  in the shape of the letter X.  This is a DAG.  The top two nodes can be viewed as root nodes.  In other words, the middle node has two parents and two children!  Here are the questions:
1. Is the above a DAG?
2. Is it a tree?
3. Are there four connected components in the graph presented above?
4. Are the strongly connected components or weakly connected components?
5. Can it be understood as the union of two connected components?
