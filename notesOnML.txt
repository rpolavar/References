1. Data science is a long term bet.  The results may not be obvious in a very short period.  The life cycle of data science models have multiple stages: definition of business problem, data acquisition, data rangling, exploratory data analysis, identification of appropriate metrics, machine learning model building, model deployment, model health check after deployment, re-training models.

2. Interprettability of the inner workings of our models and the resulting outcomes is of paramount importance in our business.  We would ultimately like to reach the goal of transparent machine learning.  This goal restricts our choices of various models.  For example, a model based on decision trees is interprettable but not a model based on random forest.  "Explainable AI is essential to building trust in our systems."  We must have the capability to verbalize our decision process.  This capability cannot be accomplished overnight.  We are interested in "clear-box" models.

3. Robust statistics are important since we have the problem of anomalies and outliers.  Arethmetic mean is quite susseptable to an outlier.  On the other hand, median is not.  However, to compute median, the data needs to be at least partially sorted.  In general, robustness comes at a cost, both in terms of compute and time.  In addition to the problem of outliers, we quite often face data that is not generated by Gaussian processes.  Many a time, we have observed that our data is distributed according to fat-tailed distributions.  Robust statistics are statistics with good performance for data drawn from a wide range of probability distributions, especially for distributions that are not normal. 

4. Distributed information processing is quite important in our work since we face huge amounts of data.  For example, the telemetry data runs up to terabytes.  Designing and developing systems with networked computers that communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages require superb architecture and take a long time.  We must pay careful atten to concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.
