Perceptron Algorithm

Invented by Frank Rosenblatt. 
12 years later, in 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert proved that single layer perceptrons cannot handle non-linearly separable patterns.
Single layer perceptrons have the inability of classifying the data that is not linearly separable.
Multilayer perceptron on the other hand can handle such data much better.
