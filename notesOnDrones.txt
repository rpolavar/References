Here are some of my initial thoughts:
1. The use case should be sound enough why we need drones but not web-cams.  Here are some of the reasons:
a. The area that needs to be covered is vast.
b. Pictures taken from time to time are more than sufficient.  Continuous stream is not needed.
c. satellite images are not fine-grained enough.  Details in the images matter.
d. Human supervision is expensive.
e. Drones can travel underneath trees and take pictures from below too.

2. We must list benefits:
a. Easy to monitor crops and their health and harvest readiness.
b. Compare and contrast the pictures from different time periods.
c. Birds, insects and pests can be observed.  To some extent, this point is covered in point a above when we have mentioned health monitoring.
d. Is it possible to deliver pesticides?
e. Is it possible to measure the soil moisture?
