1. Data engineering is neglected.  Need to learn a few things in this area.
2. How does SVM algorithm figure out in what dimensional plain the classes are separated?
3. Can Perseptron mimic SVM and solve the problem of deeling the data that is not linearly separable?
a. Kernel perceptrons seem to answer the question to some extent.  Smola and others wrote a paper in 2004 showing that Kernel perceptrons SVMs are similar.  In this context, I have also come across Forgetron which is better than kernel perceptron.  Mostly from Wikipedia.  One line from Wikipedia article on perceptrons is:
"The perceptron of optimal stability, together with the kernel trick, are the conceptual foundations of the support vector machine."
4. What is the connection between feed-farward neural networks and back propegation?
5. I must implement SVMs.
6. I need to read the book on EDA.
